# Weather App

An example of a weather app written without a front-end framework.

I used netlify functions to hide the API key from the client. 

## To run locally

```npm install```

You'll need an API key from [openweathermap.org/](openweathermap.org/) to be saved in an .env file.

.env.example is provided. 

First Build  | Start Netlify
------------- | -------------
npm run build | Yarn netlify dev
